        <h2>Featured Article - What is Fenestration in Engineering? </h2>
        Fenestration in engineering refers to the design, construction, and placement of openings in a building envelope, such as windows, doors, skylights, and other glazed surfaces. Fenestration plays a crucial role in building design and performance, affecting aspects such as natural light entry, ventilation, energy efficiency, thermal comfort, and aesthetics.
        Here are some key points about fenestration in engineering:

Natural Light and Ventilation: Well-designed fenestration allows natural light to enter the building interior, reducing the need for artificial lighting during the day. It also facilitates natural ventilation, helping to maintain indoor air quality and comfort.

Energy Efficiency: Fenestration design significantly impacts the energy performance of buildings. Energy-efficient windows and doors, equipped with features such as low-emissivity coatings, multiple glazing layers, and insulated frames, can help minimize heat gain or loss, reducing the need for heating and cooling energy.

Thermal Comfort: Properly designed fenestration contributes to maintaining thermal comfort within buildings by preventing drafts, minimizing heat transfer, and controlling solar heat gain. This is particularly important in climates with extreme temperature variations.

Acoustic Performance: Fenestration design also affects the sound insulation properties of buildings. Soundproof windows and doors can help reduce external noise infiltration, creating a quieter indoor environment.

Aesthetics and Design Integration: Fenestration elements contribute to the overall architectural expression and visual appeal of a building. Design considerations include the size, shape, placement, and style of windows and doors, as well as their compatibility with the building's overall design concept.

Building Codes and Standards: Fenestration design must comply with building codes and standards related to safety, structural integrity, fire resistance, and accessibility. These regulations ensure that fenestration systems meet minimum requirements for performance and durability.

        <h2>Latest News - Advancement in Fenestration Technology</h2>
        Advancements In Fenestration Technology & Materials
As consumers require more in terms of fenestration size and style, the technology used to manufacture these windows and solutions has kept pace. Previously, builders could simply fill the opening. Today, however, homeowners require windows and doors that align with the holistic style of the home. 

Wood Fiber-Polymer Composites 
One trend is the use of wood fiber-polymer composites. These materials are excellent for delivering contemporary, clean, crisp lines that mirror the natural beauty of wood at a more attractive price point. 

Fiberglass Windows
The overall demand for fiberglass windows continues to surge thanks to the versatility and strength of the material. 

Vinyl Window Remain Popular 
Vinyl material remains popular due to the variety of options, limited maintenance requirements, and excellent energy efficiency. In fact, vinyl windows are commanding the lion's share of the market — at 53% market share among every type of window frame material. This is approximately two times that of wood.

Easier-to-Install Systems
Manufacturers are also working toward simplifying the installation of larger fenestration components. For example, the new Easy Connect Joining System by Anderson is designed around a unique “click to connect” system. It allows installers to attach more than one window unit together in a single rough opening while meeting other performance and structural requirements. 

Performance Remains a Key Focus for Residential Fenestration Industry
Based on the 2019 “What Homebuyers Really Want” report from the NAHB, energy efficiency remains high on the list of consumer demands. For example, 38% of homebuyers felt windows and doors certified by the EPA's Energy Star Program was a must-have; while 51% found it desirable.

At the same time, 62% want the low-emissivity-coated glass to bolster thermal efficiency; while 77% want triple-pane insulating glass to reduce home energy costs and use. As the desire for larger and more windows continues to grow, these key energy efficiency and performance trends are definitely ones to watch. Other performance trends include:

Modifications to improve indoor air quality, such as skylights,that can be automatically programmed to open multiple times of the day.
Integration of windows and smart blinds based on the desire to block or admit natural light.
Smart sensor technology designed to monitor humidity, carbon dioxide, and temperature levels in the home.
